## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to build a webpage and dynamic table to provide a listing of UFO sightings filtered by multiple criteria in the database.

## Summary
Although this webpage is pretty simple to use, it doesnâ€™t allow the users to download the result list for further analysis and the search criteria are case-sensitive.

In order to provide a better experience for users, we recommend adding the following: 
1.	The ability to download searches
2.	Performing Advanced Search criteria and removing case-sensitive for performing the search.
